# Word Bomb

## Overview

This monorepo serves as a reimagining of my beloved, Bomb Party.
We're using TypeScript, with React, React Router, Vite, and Tailwind on the
frontend, and Express and Socket.IO on the backend.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
